Problem:
The primary problem addressed in the coursework thus far was efficiently managing and processing course data, including reading data from a CSV file, storing it in a suitable data structure, as well as performing operations like searching and sorting.

Approach:
To tackle these problem, I utilized data structures like vectors and binary search trees. Vectors were used to store course data in a sequential manner, while binary search trees were used for efficient searching and sorting.

Importance of Data Structures:
Data structures are fundamental to problem-solving in computer science. In this case, the choice of vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees significantly impacted the efficiency and organization of the code. Vectors provided a flexible way to store course data, while binary search trees enabled efficient searching and sorting operations.

Overcoming Roadblocks
The primary challenge encountered was effectively handling CSV data, including parsing, error handling, and data validation. This was addressed by using stringstreams to parse CSV lines and implementing checks for invalid data formats.

Another challenge was optimizing the code for performance. By understanding the time complexity of different algorithms and data structures, I was able to identify potential bottlenecks and implement improvements.

Expanding Approach to Software Design
Working on this project reinforced the importance of modularity and code reusability. Breaking down the problem into smaller, well-defined functions improved code organization and maintainability. Additionally, the use of standard algorithms and data structures provided a solid foundation for efficient problem-solving.

Evolving Code Writing Practices
This project emphasized the value of clean, readable, and maintainable code. Using meaningful variable and function names, consistent formatting, and comments significantly enhanced code clarity. By adopting a structured approach to problem-solving and breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps, the code became more adaptable to future modifications.

Overall, this project provided an opportunity to strengthen my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of data structures, and improve my coding practices.
